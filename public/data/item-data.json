This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version. It features Browning short-recoil tilting-barrel system, but very different otherwise. A purposefully simple, single-action, and no safety measures except half-cock notch, it is able to withstand horrible operating abuse. Thanks to the powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, the TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration, and impressive accuracy, even over long distances.","changeLast48hPercent":-3.71,"changeLast48h":-3.71,"containsItems":[{"itemId":"571a26d524597720680fbe8a","count":1},{"itemId":"571a282c2459771fb2755a69","count":1},{"itemId":"571a29dc2459771fb2755a6a","count":1}]},"571a26d524597720680fbe8a":{"id":"571a26d524597720680fbe8a","normalized_name":"tt-762x25-116mm-barrel","base_price":1165,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a26d524597720680fbe8a-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a26d524597720680fbe8a-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a26d524597720680fbe8a-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_7.62x25_116mm_barrel","properties":{"grid":{"pockets":[],"totalSize":0},"Recoil":-3,"Weight":0.06,"Ergonomics":-4,"bsgCategoryId":"555ef6e44bdc2de9068b457e"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":0,"updated":"2021-12-26T20:55:01.890Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":582},{"name":"Fence","price":466},{"name":"Skier","price":570},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":582},{"name":"Mechanic","price":652}],"name":"TT 7.62x25 116mm barrel","shortname":"TT 116mm","description":"Standard barrel for TT pistol.","changeLast48hPercent":0,"changeLast48h":0},"571a279b24597720b4066566":{"id":"571a279b24597720b4066566","normalized_name":"tt-762x25-121mm-homespun-threaded-barrel","base_price":2149,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a279b24597720b4066566-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a279b24597720b4066566-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a279b24597720b4066566-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_7.62x25_121mm_homespun_threaded_barrel","properties":{"grid":{"pockets":[],"totalSize":0},"Recoil":-3.25,"Weight":0.062,"Ergonomics":-5,"bsgCategoryId":"555ef6e44bdc2de9068b457e"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":0,"updated":"2021-12-24T14:25:07.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":1074},{"name":"Fence","price":859},{"name":"Skier","price":1053},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":1074},{"name":"Mechanic","price":1203}],"lastLowPrice":10420,"name":"TT 7.62x25 121mm homespun threaded barrel","shortname":"TT 121mm thr.","description":"Homespun barrel for TT pistol, with threading for sound suppressor installation.","changeLast48hPercent":0,"changeLast48h":0},"571a282c2459771fb2755a69":{"id":"571a282c2459771fb2755a69","normalized_name":"tt-side-grips","base_price":1006,"width":1,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a282c2459771fb2755a69-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a282c2459771fb2755a69-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a282c2459771fb2755a69-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_side_grips","properties":{"grid":{"pockets":[],"totalSize":0},"Weight":0.07,"Ergonomics":5,"bsgCategoryId":"55818a684bdc2ddd698b456d"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods"],"avg24hPrice":18827,"low24hPrice":2500,"high24hPrice":25000,"updated":"2021-12-26T20:46:36.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":503},{"name":"Fence","price":402},{"name":"Skier","price":492},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":503},{"name":"Mechanic","price":563}],"lastLowPrice":2500,"name":"TT side grips","shortname":"TT grips","description":"Standard post-war issue TT pistol side grips.","changeLast48hPercent":71.17,"changeLast48h":71.17},"571a28e524597720b4066567":{"id":"571a28e524597720b4066567","normalized_name":"tt-762x25-makeshift-sound-suppressor","base_price":14904,"width":2,"height":1,"icon_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a28e524597720b4066567-icon.jpg","image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a28e524597720b4066567-image.jpg","grid_image_link":"https://assets.tarkov-tools.com/571a28e524597720b4066567-grid-image.jpg","wiki_link":"https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/TT_7.62x25_makeshift_sound_suppressor","properties":{"grid":{"pockets":[],"totalSize":0},"Recoil":-10,"Weight":0.332,"Ergonomics":-12,"bsgCategoryId":"550aa4cd4bdc2dd8348b456c"},"disabled":0,"types":["mods","suppressor"],"avg24hPrice":12499,"low24hPrice":7400,"high24hPrice":17000,"updated":"2021-12-26T20:08:30.000Z","traderPrices":[{"name":"Prapor","price":7452},{"name":"Fence","price":5961},{"name":"Skier","price":7302},{"name":"Peacekeeper","price":7452},{"name":"Mechanic","price":8346}],"lastLowPrice":12000,"name":"TT 7.62x25 makeshift sound suppressor","shortname":"TT supp.","description":"Makeshift sound suppressor for TT with homespun barrel.

The rifle ensures maximum comfort of the user while aiming and shooting, featuring a quick sighting line recovery, high reliability and ergonomics. The stainless steel barrel has a thread for installing a muzzle brake-compensator or a sound suppressor.

It's a variant of the M1911, and has been the standard-issue side arm for the Force Recon Element of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Units since 1985.\n\nThe improved M45A1 features several changes to the original M1911A1 design. One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, a picatinny rail, and a desert tan Cerakote
